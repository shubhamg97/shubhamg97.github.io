    <!-- Introduction -->
    <br><h4 style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 20em"><strong>Introduction:</strong> Blackjack has a hazy origin but there is a general consensus that it probably originated in French casinos in the 18th century. The game was originally called Vingt-et-un (French for 21). Blackjack is a simple card game that requires a minimum of 2 players and a max of as many players as the deck may permit (although traditionally, the table is capped around 5-7 players + the dealer). The game itself is not played between the players but rather a dealer and individual players.</h4>



    <!-- Equipment -->
    <br><h4 style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 20em"><strong>Equipment:</strong> - 1 Deck of Cards (French Deck)
      <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - 1 Friend (More is better - minimum 1)
      <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - Optional: Chips/Tokens</h4>

      <h4>Have your friend and yourself understand the value of the cards as follows:</h4>
      <!-- 1a -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>1a) </strong>The numbered cards (2-10) are all valued at their respective pip values (2-10).</h4>
      <!-- 1b -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>1b) </strong>The face cards (J, Q, K) are all valued at 10 each.</h4>
      <!-- 1c -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>1c) </strong>And finally the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 as the player decides. When the Ace is worth 11, the sum total of your cards is said to be soft and when it's worth 1, the sum total is said to be hard. We shall learn why, later in Step 8d.</h4>

      <h4>Understand the aim of the game & the blackjack jargon as follows:</h4>
      <!-- 2a -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2a) </strong>The aim of the game is to get as close to a summed value of 21 without going bust. If the player has cards that sum to 21, that player is said to have a blackjack.</h4>
      <!-- 2b -->
      <img src="pics/hitme.jpg" width="15%" height="15%" align="right">
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2b) </strong>Bust/Going bust: When the sum of the players cards is greater than 21. When bust, the player has automatically lost this round in the game. The player needs to forfeit their bet to the dealer.</h4>
      <!-- 2c -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2c) </strong>Hit me: When the player wants another card from the deck, they say "Hit me" to the dealer. A common alternative is for the player to double tap their index finger on the table to signal the dealer to give them another card.</h4>
      <!-- 2d -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2d) </strong>Stand: If the player is sufficiently close to 21 that they don't want more cards. A common gesture to signify this is to wave the player's hands over the cards in a horizontal motion, once, to signal the dealer that their play is done for this round.</h4>
      <!-- 2e -->
      <img src="pics/stand.jpg" width="15%" height="10%" align="right">
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2e) </strong>Doubling Down: If the player finds their cards to be "winnable", the player may tell the dealer to "double down". In this move, the player puts double the amount of money as the initial bet and they take an additional card (and only that one card). If they beat the dealer, the player gets a 2 to 1 payoff.</h4>
      <!-- 2f -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2f) </strong>Insurance: When all cards are initially dealt, if  the dealer's one showing card is an Ace, the player may choose to take an insurance. If the dealer does have a blackjack, the player gets a 2 to 1 payoff. If the dealer doesn't have a blackjack, the insurance money is lost. (Traditionally, it is agreed that insurance is a bad bet, since statistically, you have more to lose than gain).</h4>
      <!-- 2g -->
      <img src="pics/split.jpeg" width="15%" height="15%" align="right">
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2g) </strong>Split: When a player's initial 2 cards are the same, they may choose to "split" their cards which offers the player better odds to beat the dealer. When split, the player will have to bet the same amount of money on the split card as his original bet. For example if the player initially bets $10 and his first two cards are (K, K), the player "splitting" will mean that the player will have to put another $10 on the table for his second K.</h4>
      <!-- 2h -->
      <!-- <img src="pics/hole.jpg" width="10%" height="10%" align="right"> -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2h) </strong>Hole: The dealer's one hidden card, not revealed until all the players on the table have finished their game</h4>
      <!-- 2i -->
      <img src="pics/blackjack.png" width="15%" height="15%" align="right">
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2i) </strong>Blackjack: The aim of the game - if the player's cards sum to 21, they have a blackjack and receive a 3 to 2 payoff from the dealer. A natural blackjack is when two cards make up the blackjack (10, A)(J, A)(Q, A) or a (K, A). A natural blackjack will have a higher rank than any other blackjack, meaning that if the dealer has a natural blackjack and the player has a 3 card blackjack, the dealer wins the round.</h4>

The dealer will then draw another card and keep it face down for himself (known as the hole). The dealer again, draws a card for each of the players and places it in front of them, face up. Finally, the dealer draws a card for himself, from the deck, placing it on top of the hole - face up. Now, each player should have two visible cards and the dealer should have two as well, with only one visible. If playing with chips, once the cards are dealt, if the players like their cards, they may increase their bet.</h4>

      <!-- 8c -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>8c) </strong>For players with a sum total of 18 or higher, it's usually a good idea to "stand"  so as to not go "bust".</h4>

      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>8d) </strong>If one of the player's first two cards is an Ace and the player doesn't have a natural blackjack, they have a soft hand because they won't go bust if they draw another card. For example if the player has an A and a 4 initially, the sum total is a soft 15. Now admittedly, this is a pretty bad hand. Luckily, since the player has a soft 15, they player may choose to "hit", drawing for example an 8. The player now has an A, a 4 and an 8, summing to a hard 13. The 13 is hard because the Ace is now valued at a 1 and it won't change value, preventing the player from going bust.</h4>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <br><h4 style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 20em"><strong>Introduction:</strong> Once a person has played a couple of rounds of Blackjack, they will start to notice that there is some basic strategy regarding when they should hit and when they should stand to increase their odds of beating the dealer. Understanding the theory behind card counting is a simple idea. If successful at card counting, what the player is doing is predicting which cards are left in the deck, mathematically of course, and adjusting their betting amount accordingly. This next section will teach you how to "count cards" to know how and when to bet higher or lower to increase winnings and minimize losses.</h4>



    <!-- Equipment -->
    <br><h4 style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 20em"><strong>Equipment:</strong> - 1 Deck of Cards (French Deck)

      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>1a) </strong>Cards between 2 - 6 are given a +1 value (+1 because every time these cards are dealt, the cards in the main deck contain higher valued cards and this indicates that the player can bet higher).</h4>

      <h4>Practice. Practice. Practice. Card Counting is not a skill that is learnt in one sitting. To that end, it is advised that you practice keeping count by shuffling a deck and then going through the entire deck, counting it. If you counted correctly, your count at the end should be 0. First practice with the deck to get the final count right, then speed yourself up. A good card counter should be able to get through the deck in under a minute.</h4>
