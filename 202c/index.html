    <!-- Introduction -->
    <br><h4 style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 30em"><strong>Introduction:</strong> Blackjack has a hazy origin but there is a general consensus that it probably originated in French casinos in the 18th century. The game was originally called Vingt-et-un (French for 21). Blackjack is a simple card game that requires a minimum of 2 players and a max of as many players as the deck may permit (although traditionally, the table is capped around 5-7 players + the dealer). The game itself is not played between the players but rather a dealer and individual players.</h4>



    <!-- Equipment -->
    <br><h4 style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 30em"><strong>Equipment:</strong> - 1 Deck of Cards (French Deck)
      <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - 1 Friend (More is better - minimum 1)
      <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - Optional: Chips/Tokens</h4>

      <h4>Have your friend and yourself understand the value of the cards as follows:</h4>
      <!-- 1a -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>1a) </strong>The numbered cards (2-10) are all valued at their respective pip values (2-10).</h4>
      <!-- 1b -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>1b) </strong>The face cards (J, Q, K) are all valued at 10 each.</h4>
      <!-- 1c -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>1c) </strong>And finally the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 as the player decides. When the Ace is worth &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 11, the sum total of your cards is said to be soft and when it's worth 1, the sum total is &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp said to be hard. We shall learn why, later in Step 8d.</h4>

      <h4>Understand the aim of the game & the blackjack jargon as follows:</h4>
      <!-- 2a -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2a) </strong>The aim of the game is to get as close to a summed value of 21 without going bust. If the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp player has cards that sum to 21, that player is said to have a blackjack.</h4>
      <!-- 2b -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2b) </strong>Bust/Going bust: When the sum of the players cards is greater than 21. When bust, the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp player has automatically lost this round in the game. The player needs to forfeit their bet &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to the dealer.</h4>
      <!-- 2c -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2c) </strong>Hit me: When the player wants another card from the deck, they say "Hit me" to the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdealer. A common alternative is for the player to double tap their index finger on the table &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to signal the dealer to give them another card.</h4>
      <!-- 2d -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2d) </strong>Stand: If the player is sufficiently close to 21 that they don't want more cards. A common &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp gesture to signify this is to wave the player's hands over the cards in a horizontal motion, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp once, to signal the dealer that their play is done for this round.</h4>
      <!-- 2e -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2e) </strong>Doubling Down: If the player finds their cards to be "winnable", the player may tell the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp dealer to "double down". In this move, the player puts double the amount of money as &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the initial bet and they take an additional card (and only that one card). If they beat the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp dealer, the player gets a 2 to 1 payoff.</h4>
      <!-- 2f -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2f) </strong>Insurance: When all cards are initially dealt, if  the dealer's one showing card is an Ace, the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp player may choose to take an insurance. If the dealer does have a blackjack, the player &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp gets a 2 to 1 payoff. If the dealer doesn't have a blackjack, the insurance money is lost. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (Traditionally, it is agreed that insurance is a bad bet, since statistically, you have more to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp lose than gain).</h4>
      <!-- 2g -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2g) </strong>Split: When a player's initial 2 cards are the same, they may choose to "split" their cards &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp which offers the player better odds to beat the dealer. When split, the player will have to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp bet the same amount of money on the split card as his original bet. For example if the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp player initially bets $10 and his first two cards are (K, K), the player "splitting" will mean &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp that the player will have to put another $10 on the table for his second K.</h4>
      <!-- 2h -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2h) </strong>Hole: The dealer's one hidden card, not revealed until all the players on the table have &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp finished their game</h4>
      <!-- 2i -->
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>2i) </strong>Blackjack: The aim of the game - if the player's cards sum to 21, they have a blackjack &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and receive a 3 to 2 payoff from the dealer. A natural blackjack is when two cards make &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp up the blackjack (10, A)(J, A)(Q, A) or a (K, A). A natural blackjack will have a higher rank &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp than any other blackjack, meaning that if the dealer has a natural blackjack and the player &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp has a 3 card blackjack, the dealer wins the round.</h4>

      <h4><strong>You're now ready to play. Never forget that you're only playing against the dealer</strong></h4>

      <h4>If playing with chips, first of all, all players need to place an initial bet on the table. To deal the cards, always deal from the dealer's left to right. For each of the players, the dealer will first draw a card from the deck and place it in front of each of the players face up. The dealer will then draw another card and keep it face down for himself (known as the hole). The dealer again, draws a card for each of the players and places it in front of them, face up. Finally, the dealer draws a card for himself, from the deck, placing it on top of the hole - face up. Now, each player should have two visible cards and the dealer should have two as well, with only one visible. If playing with chips, once the cards are dealt, if the players like their cards, they may increase their bet.</h4>
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em">NOTE: Increasing the bet is only allowed if the player doesn't have a natural blackjack.</h4>

      <h4>The round is always played clockwise from the dealer's perspective. The dealer will now ask the player to his left about what they want to do. The player can do any number of things here depending on their initial cards, the list of actions are listed from 2b to 2g.</h4>
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>8a) </strong>Traditionally, if the sum of cards is less than 10, the player should definitely "hit" until &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthey are closer to 21.</h4>
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>8b) </strong>For a player whose sum is between 14 and 18, it remains up to the player as to what they &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwant to do.</h4>
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>8c) </strong>For players with a sum total of 18 or higher, it's usually a good idea to "stand"  so as to not &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgo "bust".</h4>
      <h4 style="margin-left: 3em"><strong>8d) </strong>If one of the player's first two cards is an Ace and the player doesn't have a natural &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspblackjack, they have a soft hand because they won't go bust if they draw another card. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor example if the player has an A and a 4 initially, the sum total is a soft 15. Now &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspadmittedly, this is a pretty bad hand. Luckily, since the player has a soft 15, they player &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmay choose to "hit", drawing for example an 8. The player now has an A, a 4 and an 8, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsumming to a hard 13. The 13 is hard because the Ace is now valued at a 1 and it won't &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchange value, preventing the player from going bust.</h4>
