					<p><more>As a research intern with the Cyber Security division of QCRI, my topic of study is the "Real Time Detection and Identification of Phishing URLs and Domains". The focus of the study is on combosquatting and typosquatting domains and how they can be quickly detected and identified as benign or malicious using machine learning algorithms.
					In the first stage, I have taken websites from Alexa's top 1 million sites and then categorized and itemized them. This data is then used to query Farsight's PDNS database to gather more information about a website and it's A records. All this data is stored in several MongoDB collections, each with a purpose, to help in collecting and building information on identifying malicious domains faster and more accurately.
					In the next stage, I will be using the data we've collected as well as the data from the end-user to actually identify whether or not the domain is malicious. Initially, the identifiation will be slow since we will be building information on the dataset, but eventually this process will be, for all practical purposes, instantaneous. This stage is where I designed and used machine learning algorithms so that once the initial information is collected, the program will begin to learn by itself about the legitimacy of a domain.</more></p>

					</p>
					<p><more>WaveNet Solutions is a company that provides IoT solutions for various products in the market. My job as intern was within the Android division to create an app for the Philips HUE lighting that would take a video, extract dominant colors and then using the product SDK to provide ambient lighting for the room as well as stream the video using a media server. I created the app myself using various Android and Java libraries to achieve the task. My work primarily involved the Palette and Color tools to extract the said color with the minimum time delay and to sync the video with the lighting as well as process the information as quickly as possible whilst using the bare minimum of device resources. Here is a <a href = "https://github.com/shubhamg97/Video-Player" target = "_blank">link</a> to the project.</more></p>

					<p><more>Fully shadowed and interned with the CS-IT (Control Systems- Information Technology) department to learn the networking side of Computer Science. With the PCD (Process Control Domain) team, I've updated the Shell North Asset Inventory with up to date IP addresses as well as system information. Also worked with WMI and WSUS scripts to collect event logs of various offshore systems as well as implement self elevation to collect security logs and dynamically change save drive locations. In addition, I've observed and learnt the general activities of the PCD team as well as the industrial control systems landscapes and networks configured to meet ISA99. I've also interacted with industrial control system vendors to get permission to do some back end maintenance on systems offshore.</more></p>

Primarily worked with the PACO (Principal, Automation, Control and Optimization) team to learn how P&IDs work as well as interpreting Isometric drawings of a section of an offshore platform and understanding the link between both. With the same team, I learnt the importance of riser valves and what the O&G industry learnt from the Piper Alpha incident. Understanding their placement as well as purpose on oil rigs. Apart from the PACO team, I also talked to mechanical, piping, electrical and electronic engineers to get a handle on where my interests lie.</more></p>
