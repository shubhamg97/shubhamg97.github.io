The focus of the study is on combosquatting and typosquatting domains and how they can be quickly detected and identified as benign or malicious using machine learning algorithms. So far, I have taken websites from Alexa's top 1 million sites and then categorized and itemized them. This data is then used to query Farsight's PDNS database to gather more information about a website and it's A records. All this data is stored in various MongoDB collections to help in identifying malicious domains faster and more accurately.</more></p> -->

					<p><more>As a research intern with the Cyber Security division of QCRI, my topic of study is the "Prediction and Real-Time Detection of Phishing URLs & Domains". The focus of the study is on combosquatting and typosquatting domains and how they can be quickly detected and identified as benign or malicious using machine learning algorithms. The program was split into the following 3 components:
					<br/>1) Studied the various types of squatting domains for the top web brands. For the top 1 million Alexa ranked domains, took the top 500 and categorized them. Then used Farsight PDNS API to get first seen and last seen domain dates. In addition, I used <a href = "https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist" target = "_blank">DNSTwist API</a> to get a list of twisted/squatted domains for a given domain. And finally, I used intelligence tools like VirusTotal and Phishtank to see if a domain  was detected by their servers. All of this data was stored in several Mongo collections.
					<br/>2) Using the above data, for each of the top 500 domains, every night I would automatically collect the PDNS and intel data for the squatted domains. After all this data is collected and analyzed with a score, I was able to determine the health of a domain and all its associated twisted domains. Again, all the data is stored in several Mongo collections, each serving its own purpose.
					<br/>3) Built a web application tool using Flask and the REST API to fetch the data from the Mongo collection and display it in a web browser to essentially demonstrate parts 1 & 2. The stored JSON object is displayed to user telling them a domains health, A, NS, AAAA records, last seen, first seen dates, etc. The project was completed within a 2 month time period and the end of internship presentation was well received by a panel of judges and the internship director. The project link can be found <a href = "https://github.com/shubhamg97/Domain-Monitor" target = "_blank">here</a>.</more></p>

					</p>
					<p><more>WaveNet Solutions is a company that provides IoT solutions for various products in the market. My job as intern was within the Android division to create an app for the Philips HUE lighting that would take a video, extract dominant colors and then using the product SDK to provide ambient lighting for the room as well as stream the video using a media server. I created the app myself using various Android and Java libraries to achieve the task. My work primarily involved the Palette and Color tools to extract the said color with the minimum time delay and to sync the video with the lighting as well as process the information as quickly as possible whilst using the bare minimum of device resources. Here is a <a href = "https://github.com/shubhamg97/Video-Player" target = "_blank">link</a> to the project and the <a href = "files/wavenet_letter.pdf" target = "_blank">certificate</a> of completion.</more></p>

Primarily worked with the PACO (Principal, Automation, Control and Optimization) team to learn how P&IDs work as well as interpreting Isometric drawings of a section of an offshore platform and understanding the link between both. With the same team, I learnt the importance of riser valves and what the O&G industry learnt from the Piper Alpha incident. Understanding their placement as well as purpose on oil rigs.
